# GameOfLife

My own (not very optimized) implementation of Conway's Game Of Life.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life

An increbibly interesting turing complete cellular automata.

Includes some experiments and variations on the rules.

How to play:
-Draw initial conditions by clicking on the pygame GUI, then press ENTER to make the cells alive.
-Press Z key to toggle zooming/simulation speed modes.
-Arrow keys UP/DOWN to zoom/change simulation speed.
