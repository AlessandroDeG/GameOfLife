# GameOfLife

My own (not very optimized) implementation of Conway's Game Of Life.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life

An increbibly interesting turing complete cellular automata.

Includes some experiments and variations on the rules.


**How to play:**

-Draw initial conditions by clicking on the pygame GUI, then press ENTER to make the cells alive.

-Press Z key to toggle zooming/simulation speed modes.

-Arrow keys UP/DOWN to zoom/change simulation speed.

-Press M to toggle drawing/moving by clicking mode.


**Possible future improvements:**

-Add preset configurations (gliders, guns, etc.)

-Optimize code eg: add [Cell Lists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_lists#:~:text=Cell%20lists%20(also%20sometimes%20referred,off%20distance%20of%20each%20other.)

-Parallelization
